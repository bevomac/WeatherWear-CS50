# WeatherWear-CS50
A app wriiten with SwiftUI that displays what to wear based on the current weather.
I used SwiftUi, Appleâ€™s weather kit, Weather API, MVVM, SpriteKit, some UI and SF Symbols.
Considering i'm new to learning SwiftUI, this project took way longer than I expected. 
I would have loved to added more clothing and made it look better. That will happen soon.
